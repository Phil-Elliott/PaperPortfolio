As I search for a programming job, I want to highlight my adaptability
          and eagerness to learn. While I have significant experience in
          frontend web development, I am willing and excited to tackle any
          programming tasks that may come my way. Additionally, I am willing to
          relocate to any location for the job and do not require any relocation
          compensation.
