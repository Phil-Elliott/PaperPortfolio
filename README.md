This is my portfolio website, which I built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Here, you'll find comprehensive information about me as well as a showcase of some of my most important projects. From web development to design, this website highlights my skills and achievements. 

## What I learned

My experience working on this project has taught me valuable skills that I believe will be useful in future endeavors. Specifically, I gained proficiency in using Tailwind CSS, which enabled me to rapidly create visually appealing designs for the website. Additionally, I learned how to leverage Framer Motion to add dynamic animations, bringing the website to life and improving the overall user experience. I am excited to continue exploring these tools and applying them to future projects.
